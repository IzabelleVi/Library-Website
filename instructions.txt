SQLite Installation:

If you haven't already installed SQLite, you can download it from the official website: SQLite Download Page (If you have windows dowload; sqlite-tools-win-x64-3450200.zip).
Follow the installation instructions provided for your operating system.

Creating the Database File:

Once SQLite is installed, open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the SQLite database file is (so the folder with the website pages etc).
Run the SQLite3 command followed by the name of tthe database file. so:
sqlite3 library.db
This command puts you in the sqlite shell of library.db in your current directory.
You can now use things like SELECT * FROM Books; 
Important is that all queries (theres many usefull ones online) end with and ;

This Database is already filled but if for whatever reason your database doesnt show anything inside I added the dbCommands.txt file that hold all the commands to make 
the database structure. Then the fillDbCommands.txt file that holds all the commands to fill the database, and the addPicture.py file that when run will add all the pictures 
to the database.

To start working with the JS Files you should also dowload in a terminal (not the sqlite shell, you can use .exit to leave it) - npm install express sqlite3
